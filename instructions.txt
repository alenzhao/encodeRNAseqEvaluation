Instructions on how to submit quantification results:

GET ANNOTATION TABLES 
You can download them from here: https://github.com/ririzarr/encodeRNAseqEvaluation

First decide if you are quantifying genes or transcripts (generically called features here). Once you decide download one of these annotation tables:

gencode.v16.annotation.genes.txt.gz - if quantifying genes use this file
gencode.v16.annotation.transcripts.txt.gz - if quantifying transcripts use this file

Note: for each submission you have to pick one. But you can submit more than once. For example, you can submit a gene quantification and a transcript quantification. But you have to submit separately.

CREATE THE TAB DELIMITED QUANTIFICATION TABLE

First column has the feature IDs which are the first column of the annotation tables

First row annotates the samples: starts with “ID” then has the sample names.

The rest of the entries are the quantifications 


CREATE A SAMPLE ANNOTATION TABLE

First column are the sample names from the first row of the quantification table

First row are the attribute names: start with “SAMPLE” then the attribute names.


CREATE A README
First line: Denote if genes or transcripts
Second line: Name of the submission try to make it unique
Other lines: whatever you 


Archive the 2 tables and the README
Preferably with the tar command in unix. Example: tart -cvzf yoursubmissioname.tgz DIRNAME/*

Notes:
ArrayExpress provides some guidance on how to make the SAMPLE ANNOTATION FILES:

Bioconductor has a class that stores all these in one object: the eSet. If you want to save the annotation tables you can use the SummarizedExperiment class.
